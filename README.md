# ðŸŽ— Notes â€” Getting Set up

Make sure you have node installed. If not [download and install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## â†’ STEP #1: Install NodeJS & NPM
After installing NodeJS you can verify the install of both NodeJS and Node Package Manager by typing the following commands. This step needs to be followed only once i.e. if you don't have NodeJS installed. No need to repeat it ever again.

```bash
node -v
# v10.16.3

npm -v
# 6.10.3
```

## â†’ Step #2. Download `package.json`
